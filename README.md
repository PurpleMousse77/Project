Hello, Everyone!

        Myself Krishna Shah and today i have created my final project as a web-based application on "Care Residence".Simple responsive page which provides user to get register.User's data
are stored in database called "care.db" so that they can login & logout whenever user wants to.It also provides house services like, Maintenance, Cleaning & Parking.Also you can see when
this company was started, what is a history about this company.You can see all these information in "About" page.Which you can see in Navigation Bar.So, in nav bar there is Home, About,
Contact and a dropdown menu of Services.

        So, lets dive into Services list. In service list you can see different types of service that are provided by care residence. As this company is huge and serves their services at
different location.They serve for many different types of services.You can schedule your appoinment for whichever service you would like to take.To schedule an appoinment it will ask you

prefered date, you want service to be done.You can also give your specified message what the service provider need to know before they enter your property.There is also a cleaning services
